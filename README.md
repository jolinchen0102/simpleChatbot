# simpleChatbot
### MVP

Product implemented with django framework, deployed on Heroku

- Send questions page: https://simple-faq-collector.herokuapp.com/chatbotFAQ/question/create
- API get-questions entry point: https://simple-faq-collector.herokuapp.com/chatbotFAQ/question/

### Improvements

- No restrictions were implemented on API calls, all are exposed publicly. This will raise security concern
- Not really a chatbot, auto reply/information page can be displayed upon submission of questions
- URI resources should be better managed
- GUI design is minimal here
